      If you work out how to use <b>ADB</b> on a
      computer or use an app such as LADB, you can achieve the same
      functionality this app provides by running \"<tt><font color="#888888">adb shell</font>
      settings put secure show_rotation_suggestions 0</tt>\" to disable the
      button. Or replace the <tt>0</tt> with a <tt>1</tt> to bring it back.<br>
      <br>
      Note that both this app and the ADB method <em>might</em> fail to
      eradicate vendor-specific rotation buttons. Some vendors have their own
      toggles for this â”€ for example, in Samsung One UI you can tap the text
      below the auto-rotate button in the notification bar to access settings.
