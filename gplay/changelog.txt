1.0 - 5 May, 2021:
The first version, and hopefully also the last.

2.0 - 10 May, 2021:
- Minor UI changes.
- Fixed the app restarting on orientation change etc.
- Hopefully fixed a memory leak impacting Android 10 when pressing the back button.
- Displays a message if you're likely unrooted. This doesn't show if you're rooted but have declined access, and it may also show if there's a different error. Let's just say it needs work.

2.1 - 11 May, 2021:
- Restrict the app to only being downloadable on devices that can actually change between portrait and landscape modes using an accelerometer.
- Gave the farewell message a touch more enthusiasm.
- Miscellaneous manifest changes.

3.0 - 13 January, 2024:
- Support Android 14.
- Update minimum Android version to 9 (previously Android 8 users could install the app, where it would do nothing).
- Reduce app size a little.

3.1 - 14 January 2024:
- The previous version broke the refresh button! This update unbreaks it.
- Support themed home screen icons.
